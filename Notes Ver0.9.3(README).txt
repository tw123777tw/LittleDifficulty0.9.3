Development Notes:
This game was made in 7 days(July 7-11, 2022) under a self-imposed challenge to get used to RPG Maker MV. It should mostly be complete, but quality is not assured (which is why it is ver0.9), so please leave a comment under the original posts if you want to leave feedback!

0.9.1 Update -
Re-added the animations that went missing
0.9.2 Update -
Fixed the glitch where the Merchant EX doesn't allow a Goddess Coin.
Fixed the glitch where Goddess Easy stays in a dark room and doesn't fade in
0.9.3 Update-
Fixed the issue where Goddess Coin isn't granted if Goddess is beaten on Normal difficulty while angry (she does while calm so it isn't locked out)
